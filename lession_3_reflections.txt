1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when we want public contributors o when we are working in a team.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we know better when to pull , as we as a developer know better when it will be beneficial or when a new feature will be added.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is just clonig someone's repository to our's but not locally bit in out github page. clones means to clone simply the repository locally and branches are somewhat i ahve described earlier which are used to add a new feature like a beta version of your final code
